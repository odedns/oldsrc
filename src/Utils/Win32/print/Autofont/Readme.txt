The attached files illustrate different formats of the same mapping file for E-Form identified as 150.

* “Form150-Escape-With Lines Break.MAP” – This mapping file is using the ASCII Escape character and it is structured with line breaks for systems, which has limits on the line maximum length.

* “Form150-Tilde-With Lines Break.MAP” – This mapping file is using the Tilde character instead of the ASCII Escape character (i.e. MF/AS-400 systems) and it is structured with line breaks for systems, which has limits on the line maximum length.

* “Form150-Escape-Without Lines Break.MAP” – This mapping file is using the ASCII Escape character and it is structured in a single line without breaks for systems, which has no limits on the line maximum length.

* “Form150-Tilde-Without Lines Break.MAP” – This mapping file is using the Tilde character instead of the ASCII Escape character (i.e. MF/AS-400 systems) and it is structured in a single line without breaks for systems, which has no limits on the line maximum length.

* “Form150-Escape-With Lines Break and Printing Controls.MAP” – This mapping file is using the ASCII Escape character and it is structured with line breaks for systems, which has limits on the line maximum length. It is also hold Place-Holders to control:
[##Copies] - 1 to n
[##Tray] - 2 = Manual tray, 4 = Casset tray
[##Duplex] - 0 = Simplex, 1 = Duplex

* “Form150-Tilde-With Lines Break and Printing Controls.MAP” – This mapping file is using the Tilde character instead of the ASCII Escape character (i.e. MF/AS-400 systems) and it is structured with line breaks for systems, which has limits on the line maximum length. It is also hold Place-Holders to control:
[##Copies] - 1 to n
[##Tray] - 2 = Manual tray, 4 = Casset tray
[##Duplex] - 0 = Simplex, 1 = Duplex
