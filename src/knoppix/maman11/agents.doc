Agents.DOC
___________

This is a program that simulates parallel operations on the same account.

A Father process initiate an account file with a start sum, and
sends some Agents to perform independent operations.
Every agent updates the account after each operation, and list his
operation in a personal log file.

There is  also a Controller who checks if the data in the log files is
consistent with the amount written in the account file.
 
If it isn't it will state "Thieves in the system!" and will end
the program.


Syntax: agents N
                  N is the number of parallel agents (actually: 0 < N <= 8 ).

The program generates the following files:
account  - The situation of the common account.
a,b,c... - Each file is the log tracing the operation of each agent.
