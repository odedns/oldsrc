The cached object list should be sorted.
when putting a new object to the list, should sort the list 
or should sort the list every time a user request the entire list.

should support partial loaded entities in the business cache ?
when a entity is not loaded automatically, and a user perform put of one 
object to the entity cached object list, in that case the list is partial and don't contain all the values.
