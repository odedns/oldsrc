  /** 
   * <a href=supportingDocumentation/overview.html>Overview of NML-EML interface</a>
   *
   * <p>This module contains the definition of the performance management types and structures
   * of the NML-EML interface.
   * It also contains the definition of the performance management manager.</p>
   *
   * <p>PM functionality for ATM is not supported in this release of the interface.</p>
   *
   * <p>The NMS can enable and disable the collection of PM Data.
   * The NMS may specify a list of Termination Points and the set of PM parameters (e.g. nearEnd 
   * and/or farEnd) for which measurement of PM parameters may be turned on/off.
   * The NMS may specify a list of Termination Points, the set of PM parameters (e.g. nearEnd and/or 
   * farEnd) and the time window for the delivery of history PM data records.
   * The transfer of history PM data is by FTP.  The NMS may query 
   * the EMS for the time period within which PM data records may be retrieved once the 
   * corresponding collection bin is closed.
   * The NMS may query the EMS for the supported PM parameters of an ME.
   * The NMS may also query for current PM data records.</p>
   * <p>
   * The NMS may enable/disable notification of threshold crossing alerts by constructing the 
   * appropriate filter via the notification service. 
   * The NMS may set the threshold for the TCA for each of the supported TCA types per 
   * TP/layerRate measurement point.
   * The NMS may retrieve the current values of TCA thresholds for a Termination Point.
   * The NMS may enable/disable TCA generation.</p>
   *
