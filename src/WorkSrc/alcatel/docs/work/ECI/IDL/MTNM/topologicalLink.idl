  /**
   * <p>The TopologicalLink structure provides information to the NMS
   * to allow it to present and interpret a topological view of the network
   * managed by the EMSes.</p>
   * 
   * <p>For details on how topologicalLinks should be modelled see
   * <a href=supportingDocumentation/layers.pdf>layering</a>.</p>
   *
   * <p>The rate of a TopologicalLink describes the layer at which the
   * link is modelled. E.g. in SDH links could be modelled at the RS
   * layer and the MS layer.</p>
   *
   * <p>A TopologicalLink has a name and references to the two TPs. These TPs
   * are either both CTPs or both PTPs (i.e. cannot be a mix PTP-CTP)</p>
   *
   * <p>For a TP that is connected outside of the EMS' span of control, if the EMS
   * knows about the remote end, the EMS may provide this information via 
   * a single-ended topological link. See 
   * <a href=supportingDocumentation/objectNaming.html>Object Naming</a>
   * for details of naming "off network" TPs.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note that an ATM link is an example of TopologicalLink terminated by CTPs 
   * defined at LR_ATM_NI layer rate. Such a link is used to transport VP traffic 
   * and 'VC without VP' traffic between ATM NEs. Another example would be a VP 
   * trail internal to an ATM subnetwork. The EMS should expose such a trail
   * (created as a subnetwork connection between two terminated and mapped CTPs
   * defined at the LR_ATM_VP Layer Rate) as a topological link since this VP is
   * a component of the ATM infrastructure used for VC traffic (PVCCs or SVCCs).</p> 
   *
   * globaldefs::NamingAttributes_T <b>name</b>:
   * <dir>The name represents the name of the
   * Topological Link which is assigned by the EMS upon creation.
   * The EMS is responsible for guaranteeing the uniqueness of the name
   * within the context of the EMS.
   * It is a readonly attribute.</dir>
   *
   * string <b>userLabel</b>:
   * <dir>The user label of the topological link is NMS Data
   * (typically end-to-end trail data). This could be used by the EMS 
   * to display to the user (to associate topological links to the NMS data),
   * but this is not a requirement on the EMS to display on its GUI.
   * The userLabel is provisionable by the NMS. This attribute can be set
   * by NMS through the Common_I interface service
   * <a href=_common.Common_I.html#common::Common_I::setUserLabel>setUserLabel</a>. 
   * It is a read/write attribute.</dir>
   *
   * string <b>nativeEMSName</b>:
   * <dir>The name represents how the link is refered to on EMS displays. Its
   * aim is to provide a "nomenclature bridge" the aid relating information
   * presented on NMS displays to EMS displays (via GUI cut through).
   * The native name is defaulted to a NULL string. However, this could
   * be used by the EMS for its implementation dependent purpose.</dir>
   *
   * string <b>owner</b>
   * <dir>The owner is provisionable by the NMS. This attribute can be set
   * by NMS through the Common_I interface service
   * <a href=_common.Common_I.html#common::Common_I::setOwner>setOwner</a>. 
   * It is a read/write attribute.</dir>
   *
   * globaldefs::ConnectionDirection_T <b>direction</b>
   * <dir>Direction of the topological link.  A topological link can be unidirectional even
   * if both its ends are bidirectional TPs.</dir>
   *
   * transmissionParameters::LayerRate_T <b>rate</b>:
   * <dir>The layer of the topological link.</dir>
   *
   * globaldefs::NamingAttributes_T <b>aEndTP</b>:
   * <dir>Name of A end TP.</dir>
   *
   * globaldefs::NamingAttributes_T <b>zEndTP</b>:
   * <dir>Name of Z end TP.</dir>
   *
   * globaldefs::NVSList_T <b>additionalInfo</b>:
   * <dir>This attribute allows the communication from the EMS to the NMS of additional 
   * information which is not explicitly modelled.
   * This may be an empty list.
   * It is a readonly attribute.</dir>
