import java.util.Comparator;

/**
 * A comparison function, which imposes a total ordering on some collection
 * of objects. Comparators can be passed to a sort method
 * (such as Collections.sort) to allow precise control over the sort order.
 * Comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data structures
 * (such as TreeSet or TreeMap).
 * The ordering imposed by a Comparator c on a set of elements S is said to be
 * consistent with equals if and only if (compare((Object)e1, (Object)e2)==0)
 * has the same boolean value as e1.equals((Object)e2) for every e1 and e2 in S.
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit Comparator c is used
 * with elements (or keys) drawn from a set S.
 * If the ordering imposed by c on S is inconsistent with equals, the sorted
 * set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."
 * In particular the sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general
 * contract for set (or map), which is defined in terms of equals.
 *
 * For example, if one adds two keys a and b such that
 * (a.equals((Object)b) && c.compare((Object)a, (Object)b) != 0) to a sorted
 * set with comparator c, the second add operation will return false
 * (and the size of the sorted set will not increase) because a and b are
 * equivalent from the sorted set's perspective.

	 * by allowing programs to determine that two distinct Comparators impose
	 * the same order.
