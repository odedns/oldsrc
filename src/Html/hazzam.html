<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>I'm currently working in a software company called Memco
Inc. as a Vice President of</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+1>International Operations.
(in other words a "kasha").</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You may also know me for my poems.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>I am quite a successful poet setting a new trend in poetry
called '<B><I>kasha poetry</I>'</B>.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact I have been a mentor for quite a few young poets
who have taken their talents to the path of kasha poetry.</FONT>

Unfortunately, the creator of this page,&nbsp; and his friends, members
of the Gideon Hazzam fan club, did not save most of my work in their e-mail
boxes, so until the idol himself can resend some of his precious early
work, we will have to settle for his current poems, which are published
here.

Office Security</H3>
<I>To: Memco employees</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>As&nbsp; you&nbsp; might&nbsp; have&nbsp; noticed,&nbsp; lately we
have been using the services of a</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>security&nbsp; company&nbsp; to&nbsp; guard&nbsp; our&nbsp; offices&nbsp;
every&nbsp; night.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the guard is</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>unfamiliar&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; faces of Memco employees, and
since we wish to avoid</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>any&nbsp; uncomfortable situation for either side, we hereby ask
you to follow a</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>simple rule; Whenever an employee enters the office after the usual
working</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>hours,&nbsp; he/&nbsp; she should identify himself/ herself as well
as any guest that</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>comes&nbsp; with&nbsp; him/&nbsp; her&nbsp; to the guard. This way
there will be no unnecessary</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>suspicion&nbsp; on&nbsp; behalf of the guard, and no unwanted discomfort
on behalf of</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>the employees.</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>You&nbsp; will&nbsp; receive&nbsp; further&nbsp; information&nbsp;
and instructions soon, as well as</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;</I>

<P><I>personal&nbsp; badges&nbsp; that&nbsp; will&nbsp; quicken&nbsp; the&nbsp;
identification&nbsp; process&nbsp; of the</I>

<H3>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Analysis of Office Guard by Prof. Bilu.</FONT></H3>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Here goes:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The general atmosphere of this poem is dark and foreboding.
While we still see a faint shadow of the poet's earlier style - the spaces
before commas and periods - the evident use os a spell checker ruins much
of the primal joy his earlier work had given us. A lone beacon in this
aphotic umbra is the word, or more precisely, the concatenation of letters,
"finalised".</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Obviously, as my esteemed colleague Mr. Shahar once noted,
Hazzam can't spell shit, thus I am quite certain that the above observation,
of a spell checker being used, must be true. But how can we explain this
"finalised"?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>I contend that this is yet another example of the poet's
genius. Among all these opaque, spell-checked words, we see&nbsp; "finalised"
shining through, as if saying "I am still the old poet you know and love,
I still can't spell shit."</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Note also the unnecessary space, both before and after
"finalised", as if to emphasize the poet's unique style.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>"Office guard" deals with the artist's feeling that his
work (which might be a metaphor for life in general) is turning into a
battle ground, hinting the final battle of Armageddon. The rest of this
analysis will be dedicated to&nbsp; unveiling the many military metaphors
by which the poet dispenses his feelings of looming doom.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>First and foremost is the poem's title, "Office guard".
Simply ingenious! The whole paradigm of the poem is folded into one short
phrase - the consolidation of civil work, symbolized by "office", with
military one - "guard", and the feeling of danger ahead:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What does an office need a guard?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Normally, it doesn't.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Thus, Hazzam forces us to conclude that something terrible
is about to happen, against which this protection is necessary.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>gideon@memco.co.il wrote:</FONT>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; As some of you probably noticed , we have started
to use a security company</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; to secure our office .</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The first couplet starts softly, building our fear slowly.
Pianissimo: "As some of you probably noticed". That is, the poet assures
us that what he is about to say, is not news to us. It is something we
already know, or at the very least,"noticed".</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>The poet is saying: Did the title of this poem make you
anxious? Relax. I am only about to explain something which you've already
noticed on your own. He lures us into trusting him, only to make our revelation
at the end much more powerful.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sentence continues with the elaborate grammar for
which the poet is well known, and continues with a small joke, intending
to calm us further. The joke, for those of you not familiar with Kasha
Humor, is the double meaning of "security company".</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Memco is a security company, and "has started using"
a security company - Memco might very well be hiring itself, entrapping
itself in an endless loop.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Is this the danger Hazzam is warning us against?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>I don't think so. This is merely a joke.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the second line puts us on edge again. "Secure
the office". What for? Against whom? Our questions are left dangling in
the void between the two paragraphs.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; The plan is to have a guard as of 20:00 to
08:30 (evening and night shift)</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; every day during the week , and 24 h a day
during the weekends.</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; Their base will be the main reception desk
in the 3rd floor .</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; Soon , all office security procedures will
be&nbsp; finalised ,&nbsp; and the guard</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; will be following them during his shift .</FONT></I>
<BR><I><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The main part of the poem is dedicated into transforming
the office, in our mind, from a civil work place to a military camp.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The word shift is used twice, at the end of the first
and last line. Again, this is an ingenious choice, since "shift" is both
used to describe rotation of guards, and the time frame in which people
work in an office (or at least a factory).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So "shift" from the first line to the last is tying up
the civil with the military, and shifts our state</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>of mind between these two extremes as well.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another important point is the use of army language. This
is evident by the use of digits instead of words when ever possible, the
making of a "plan", the use of "procedures", the bad grammar ("have a guard
as of"), the use of redundancy to give the illusion of power ("main reception
desk" as if there's another, subsidiary, reception desk), and the explicit
metamorphosis of a desk into a "base" and of corridors and rooms into patrol
routes and guard posts.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But what really happens here?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Did we discover why the office needs guarding? What is
the danger ahead?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Not at all!</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>More over, we got only a vague idea as to what the plan
is, as the exact "office security procedures" are not described, maybe
do not even exist.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>All that is implied, by the use of the word "all", is
that there are many such procedures.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I think the poet's intent is twofold:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>A vague plan with procedures which in part do not exist,
and in part are kept secret, is characteristic of military plans - thus
enhancing the "office transformed into army base" sentiment.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>But there is much more than this - the poet intentionally
leaves us guessing, wondering, lost and afraid.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp; <I>Meanwhile , be aware of their present in the
office .</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last but not least, we are reminded that a spell checker
is no help when the meaning of the words are not known.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Since present is a word, the spell checker does not inform
the poet that his readers would have expected the word "presence" instead.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>But is this really a mistake?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Don't underestimate the Kasha.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>The present is in the office.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>The present of the nameless, faceless, guards.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>And also our own present.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But what about the future?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>We are left with a terrible feeling about this unknown
future, and stating that the present is in the office, leads usto suspect
that the future is somewhere else.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the future of this humble literary critic is probably
not in the office. At least, not this one.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Take care, and congratulations to all of us who are getting
married,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kasha Blue.</FONT>
