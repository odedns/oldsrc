<B>EEL</B>, name applied to any elongated, serpentlike fish, but particularly
to members of the order Anguilliformes, comprising more than 600 diverse
species grouped into about 19 families within two suborders. One suborder,
the Anguilloidei, includes the freshwater eel, snake eel, worm eel, conger
EEL (q.v.) , MORAY (q.v.) , and a few others. The other suborder, the
Saccopharyngoidei, includes forms adapted to life at depths as great as 3000
m (10,000 ft), such as the gulper eel, the swallower eel, and still more
bizarre and highly modified fishes. A few unrelated fishes with somewhat
eellike forms are also called eels, such as the electric eel ( see ELECTRIC
FISH). Eels inhabit marine and fresh waters worldwide. Most eels have no
scales. Their dorsal and anal fins may extend along most of the body and
be continuous with the tail fin. Undulating motions of these fins or the
whole body provide thrust for swimming. Most species are less than 1 m (less
than 3 ft) long. One conger eel, Conger conger, however, is known to grow
up to 3 m (up to 9 ft) long. Eels of the family Anguillidae live in fresh
water as adults and return to the open ocean to spawn. These freshwater eels,
important as food and often sold live in markets, have dense capillary systems
close to the skin that can absorb oxygen directly from air or water. The
eels hatch from eggs as leptocephali, which are transparent, very thin, leaflike
larvae little resembling the adults. They drift in the ocean for as long
as three years, feeding on plankton, then metamorphose into round-bodied
young eels called elvers, or grass eels, and feed on fish and invertebrates
until they reach full size. The migration and reproduction of freshwater
eels remained a mystery until the 20th century, when their spawning beds
were discovered in the Sargasso Sea between Bermuda and Puerto Rico. When
the very similar European eel, Anguilla anguilla, and the American eel, A.
rostrata, reach maturity in freshwater lakes and rivers, they take watercourses,
sometimes slithering overland through dewy grass, to reach the ocean, where
they swim or drift with currents for as long as a year until they reach the
sluggish, weed-filled Sargasso. Here the eels spawn in deep water, and, before
dying, the female produces as many as 20 million free-floating eggs. The
leptocephali drift with the Gulf Stream, taking one year to reach North America
and three years to reach Europe. By this time they have become elvers and
accumulate at the mouths of rivers in great masses. The yellow elvers swim
upstream and feed on lake- and river-bottom animals until they become
black-and-silver-bodied adults, completing the cycle.
